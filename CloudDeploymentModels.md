### **Cloud Deployment Models**

#### **What is a Cloud Deployment Model?**
A cloud deployment model determines how cloud services are deployed, the infrastructure's ownership, scale, access type, and the relationship between the infrastructure and users. It defines:
- The location of the servers and who controls them.
- Whether the services are pre-provided or need to be built by the user.
- How data and applications are distributed among stakeholders.
